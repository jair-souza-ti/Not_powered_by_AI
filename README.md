The entire project revolves around the simple idea of the exciting and dangerous potential of an AI like ChatGPT. Using HTML 5 and CSS 3, a website with a clean and intuitive design was built, with few options for the user, thus maximizing the main goal of the site, which is for the reader to read and follow the articles, reading from the most positive to the most negative at the end of the journey.

This was a study project, there is no commercial gain involved. If there's anything in the code that interests you, feel free to use it. And if you want to have a coffee and chat about AI, I'm always available.
